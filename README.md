# NexysA7-100T Piano Synthesizer

## Functionality
-The Microblaze microcontroller system (MCS) is ran on the Nexys A7 FGPA. It is integrated with the Fpro system developed by Dr. Pong Chu in his textbook,FPGA Prototyping by SystemVerilog Examples

-The hardware is exported and used in Vitis where a collection of driver scripts control the functionality of the Fpro system.

-The physical system itself consists of the NexysA7 100T FPGA board, a USB keyboard that is compatible with the PS2 communication protocol, a VGA monitor, and any speaker that can be connected via AUX port
